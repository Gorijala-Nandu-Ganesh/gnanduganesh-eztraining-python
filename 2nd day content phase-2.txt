POLYMORPHISM-
-->One item or same item used for different purposes.
   Types:-
   1)Overloading
     (a)Operator overloading
        ex- 5+10=15
            "5"+"10"=510
     (b)Method overloading
   2)Over riding-If a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from base class or parent class.

DATA STRUCTURES:-

-->Helps to write efficient programs.
-->Linear-array/linked list/stack/queue/matrix.
-->Non linear-binary tree/heap/hash table/graph.
-->Linear-storing data sequently.
-->Non linear-no sequential style required.

****Priority-linkedlist>graphs>trees.

-->Static-which has fixed size.ex-array
-->Dynamic-which is flexible for changing its size.ex-list,stack,queue.

-->Linked list:-as the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called linked list. ex: train
   Types:singly/doubly/circular.

-->Creating linked list:
   step 1-create the node.
   step 2-partition the node with 2 segments data and none.
   step 3-add value into the blank node.
   step 4-mark the node as head.
   step 5-create the next node by following the above steps.
   step 6-establish link between 1st node and 2nd node.
-->Displaying linked list:
   Traversal is required from first node till tail node inorder to display existing linked list.
 Operations-
  -->Inserting node at beginning,ending and at any position.
  -->Deleting
  -->Searching
