EXCEPTION HANDLING
-->when there is exception the developer does not want iinterruption or disturbance in the program flow to achieve this, so we are using exception handling.
ex-
a=100
b=0
try:
    print(a/b)
except Exception :
    print("Please note, number can't be divided by zero")
print("bye")

#with e
a=100
b=0
try:
    print(a/b)
except Exception as e:
    print("Please note, number can't be divided by zero")
print("bye")
o/p-Please note, number can't be divided by zero
    Bye

OOPS (Object Oriented Programming Structure)
-->its an efficient concept use in all object oriented programming languages like Java and Python.
-->for multiple reasons we use oops concept.
   for example- code reusability,data security,holding data.
 Class- its a blue print
       ex- birds,laptops
 Object- its a thing created based on class.
   note-one class can have multiple objects.
ex- class=birds-object=peacock,parrot,crow,swan.
    class=laptop-object=Lenova,HP,DELL,Apple.
   #class computer:
    def config(self):
        print("Yes")
    lenova=computer() #object 1
    lenova.config()
    dell=computer()   #object 2
    dell.config()
o/p-Yes
    Yes
