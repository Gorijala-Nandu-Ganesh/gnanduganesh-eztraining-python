-->Python is invented by "Guido Van Rossum".

-->Python is famous in the market and it is called as language of future. It supports current technologies and upcomming technologies.

-->Mediums- IDLE(Integrated development learning environment), jupiter notebook, anaconda, thony, vs code.

-->Code format in IDLE:-
   correct format:
   boy=45
   _4x=100
   _hii=45
   wrong format:
   45=boy
   4_x=b

-->Data types:-

   1)Numerical
    integer(34)
    float(5.6)
    complex(5+6+7)
    ex- type(34)=int

   2)Boolean
    True(1)
    False(0)
    ex-type(True)=bool or
       bool(1)=True
  
   3)Sequence
    string, list, dictionary, tuple
    ex-list=([4,5])

   4)ex-id(27)=2217716024368

   5)ex-isinstance("hii",str)
        True

   Operators precedence and associativity law:-

-->Every operator has its own priority, we can use BODMAS rule(Bracket, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

-->If there is same priority operators in the expression evaluation happens left to right except assignment(=) operator which evaluates right to left.
