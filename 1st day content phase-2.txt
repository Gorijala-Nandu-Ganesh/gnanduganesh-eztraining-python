Functions:-
Lambda function:
-->It is called as anonymous function.When a function is there by without using function name, there we apply concept of lambda function.

****Four pillars of oops:
1)Abstraction
2)Encapsulation
3)Inheritance
4)Polymorphism

1)Abstraction
-->Hiding the implementation part,showing where is required for users is called as abstraction.
   ex:exe file
  we can make class or method as abstract,opposite to extract is concrete.

2)Encapsulation
-->Binding data and function into a single entity.
There are three types.
>>>>Public-one class info can be accessed by any other class.
>>>>Private-can used where it is declared/no   inheritected class.
>>>>Protected-can be accessed only when it got declared....whichever class is inherited from this class there also we can use.
-->public----low level data protection.
-->private----medium level.
-->protected----high level.

3)Inheritance
-->Base class and derived class.
     Derived class will inherit properties of base calss.
Base class----parent class.
Derived class----child class.
-->Types:-
 1)Single Inheritance(ex. parent,child)
 2)Multiple Inheritance(ex. dad,mom,child)
 3)Multi-level Inheritance(ex. grandparent,parent,child)
 4)Hierarical Inheritance(ex. parent,child1,child2)
 5)Hybrid Inheritance(ex. parent,child1,child2,kid1,kid2,kidd1,kidd2)

-->a-public
-->b-protected
-->c-private
